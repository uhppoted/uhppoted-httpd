# uhppoted-httpd

`uhppoted-httpd` implements an HTTP server that provides a browser based user interface for an access control system based
on UHPPOTE TCP/IP controllers. It is intended to supplement the existing command line tools and application integrations.

## Status

_In development_

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- ARM7 _(e.g. RaspberryPi)_

## Raison d'Ãªtre

_CAVEAT EMPTOR_

Although `uhppoted-httpd` does provide a functional and usable user interface for managing a small'ish access
control system, the out-of-the-box look and feel is (deliberately) workaday, low key and plain with the intention
of being a base for your own customisation (with your own logos, themes, functionality, etc) rather than as a 
finshed, shippable product.

Also, please be aware that at this stage in its career, it is primarily a testbed for validating the design and
implementation of the other `uhppoted` components when integrated into a working system. It is also intended to
become a platform for exploring some alternative ideas around user interfaces and system architectures.

## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/releases):

The release tarballs contain the executables for all the operating systems - OS specific tarballs with all the _uhppoted_ components can be found in [uhpppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice. To install `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service:
```
   cd <uhppoted directory>
   sudo uhppoted-httpd daemonize
```

`uhppoted-httpd help` will list the available commands and associated options (documented below).

The `daemonize` command will create all the necessary files for `uhppoted-httpd` if they do not exist already:

- `uhppoted.conf`
- access lists
- GRULES files
- HTML files

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- make (optional but recommended)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org) (optional but recommended)
- [eslint-config-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard) (optional but recommended)

**NOTE:**

_`apt install` sass on Ubuntu installs `ruby-sass` which was marked [obsolete](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass)
in 2019. Please follow the installation instructions on the [Sass homepage](https://sass-lang.com) to install
the current version._


To build using the included Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd.git
cd uhppoted-httpd
make build
```

Without using `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd.git
cd uhppoted-httpd
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/light:httpd/html/css/default
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/light:httpd/html/css/light
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/dark:httpd/html/css/dark
cp httpd/html/images/light/* httpd/html/images/default
go build -trimpath -o bin/ ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppoted-httpd` executable to the `bin` directory.

## uhppoted-httpd

Usage: ```uhppoted-httpd <command> <options>```

Supported commands:

- `help`
- `version`
- `config`
- `run`
- `console`
- `daemonize`
- `undaemonize`

Defaults to `run` if the command it not provided i.e. ```uhppoted-httpd <options>``` is equivalent to 
```uhppoted-httpd run <options>```.

### `run`

Runs the `uhppoted-httpd` HTTP server. Default command, intended for use as a system service that runs in the 
background. 

Command line:

` uhppoted-httpd [--debug] [--console] [--config <file>] `

```
  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations. 
                Defaults to the communal uhppoted.conf file shared by all the uhppoted modules.
  --console     Runs the HTTP server endpoint as a console application, logging events to the console.
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the 
                UHPPOTE controllers
```

### `daemonize`

Registers `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service that will be started on system boot. The command creates the necessary
system specific service configuration files and service manager entries. On Linux it defaults to using the 
`uhppoted:uhppoted` user:group - this can be changed with the `--user` option

Command line:

`uhppoted-httpd daemonize [--user <user>]`

### `undaemonize`

Unregisters `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service, but does not delete any created log or configuration files. 

Command line:

`uhppoted-httpd undaemonize `

## Supporting files

### `uhppoted.conf`

`uhppoted.conf` is the communal configuration file shared by all the `uhppoted` project modules and is (or will 
eventually be) documented in [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted). `uhppoted-httpd` requires:
- the _HTTPD_ section to define the configuration for the HTTP server
- the _devices_ section to resolve non-local controller IP addresses and door to controller door identities.

The `daemonize` command will create a `uhppoted.conf` file if one does not exist, or update the existing file
with the default configuration.

### HTML files

### `auth.json`

### `ACL.grl`

### GRULES files
