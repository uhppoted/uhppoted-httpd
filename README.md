# uhppoted-httpd

`uhppoted-httpd` implements an HTTP server that provides a browser based user interface for an access control system based
on UHPPOTE TCP/IP controllers. It is intended to supplement the existing command line tools and application integrations.

## Status

_In development_

Supported operating systems:
- Linux
- MacOS
- Windows
- ARM7 _(e.g. RaspberryPi)_

## Raison d'Ãªtre

_CAVEAT EMPTOR_

Although `uhppoted-httpd` does provide a functional and usable user interface for managing a small'ish access
control system, the out-of-the-box look and feel is (deliberately) workaday, low key and plain with the intention
of being a base for your own customisation (with your own logos, themes, functionality, etc) rather than a 
finished, shippable product.

Also, please be aware that at this stage in its career, it is primarily a testbed for validating the design and
implementation of the other `uhppoted` components when integrated into a working system. It is also intended to
become a platform for exploring some alternative ideas around user interfaces and system architectures.

## Releases

| *Version* | *Description*                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| v0.8.0    | Initial release                                                                           |
|           |                                                                                           |

## Installation

Executables for all the supported operating systems are packaged in the [releases](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/releases):

The release tarballs contain the executables for all the operating systems - OS specific tarballs with all the _uhppoted_ components can be found in [uhpppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted/releases) releases.

Installation is straightforward - download the archive and extract it to a directory of your choice. To install `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service:
```
   cd <uhppoted directory>
   sudo uhppoted-httpd daemonize
```

`uhppoted-httpd help` will list the available commands and associated options (documented below).

The `daemonize` command will create all the necessary files for `uhppoted-httpd` if they do not exist already:

- `uhppoted.conf`
- access lists
- GRULES files
- HTML files

### Quickstart

A sample set of the files used by `uhppoted-httpd` is included in a [starter kit](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/tree/master/documentation/starter-kit) and a tar.gz file that includes the platform executable is included in 
the release set as `quickstart-xxx.tar.gz`

To use the _quickstart_, download and unpack the _tar.gz_ file for your platform and execute `uhppoted-httpd` as a console 
application. e.g. for MacOS:

```
wget https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/releases/download/v0.8.0/quickstart-darwin_v0.8.0.tar.gz
mkdir -p uhppoted-httpd
tar xvzf quickstart-darwin.tar.gz --directory uhppoted-httpd
cd uhppoted-httpd
./uhppoted-httpd --config uhpppoted.conf --debug --console
```

The default user name and password for the quickstart are _admin_ and _uhppoted_ respectively.

### Building from source

Required tools:
- [Go 1.18+](https://go.dev)
- [sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- make (optional but recommended)
- [eslint](https://eslint.org) (optional but recommended)
- [eslint-config-standard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-standard) (optional but recommended)

**NOTE:**

_`apt install` sass on Ubuntu installs `ruby-sass` which was marked [obsolete](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass)
in 2019. Please follow the installation instructions on the [Sass homepage](https://sass-lang.com) to install
the current version._


To build using the included Makefile:

```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd.git
cd uhppoted-httpd
make build
```

Without using `make`:
```
git clone https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd.git
cd uhppoted-httpd
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/light:httpd/html/css/default
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/light:httpd/html/css/light
sass --no-source-map sass/themes/dark:httpd/html/css/dark
cp httpd/html/images/light/* httpd/html/images/default
go build -trimpath -o bin/ ./...
```

The above commands build the `uhppoted-httpd` executable to the `bin` directory.

## uhppoted-httpd

Usage: ```uhppoted-httpd <command> <options>```

Supported commands:

- `help`
- `version`
- `config`
- `run`
- `console`
- `daemonize`
- `undaemonize`

Defaults to `run` if the command it not provided i.e. ```uhppoted-httpd <options>``` is equivalent to 
```uhppoted-httpd run <options>```.

### `run`

Runs the `uhppoted-httpd` HTTP server. Default command, intended for use as a system service that runs in the 
background. 

Command line:

` uhppoted-httpd [--debug] [--console] [--config <file>] `

```
  --config      Sets the uhppoted.conf file to use for controller configurations. 
                Defaults to the communal uhppoted.conf file shared by all the uhppoted modules.
  --console     Runs the HTTP server endpoint as a console application, logging events to the console.
  --debug       Displays verbose debugging information, in particular the communications with the 
                UHPPOTE controllers
```

### `daemonize`

Registers `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service that will be started on system boot. The command creates the necessary
system specific service configuration files and service manager entries. On Linux it defaults to using the 
`uhppoted:uhppoted` user:group - this can be changed with the `--user` option

Command line:

`uhppoted-httpd daemonize [--user <user>]`

### `undaemonize`

Unregisters `uhppoted-httpd` as a system service, but does not delete any created log or configuration files. 

Command line:

`uhppoted-httpd undaemonize `

## Supporting files

### `uhppoted.conf`

`uhppoted.conf` is the communal configuration file shared by all the `uhppoted` project modules and is (or will 
eventually be) documented in [uhppoted](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted). The `daemonize` command will 
create a `uhppoted.conf` file if one does not exist, or update the existing file with the default configuration.

The configuration for `uhppoted-httpd` is defined in the [_HTTPD_](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/uhppoted.conf.md) section.

### HTML files

By default, the static files for the user interface are served from a file system embedded in the application
executable. For customisation, the static files can be relocated to an external folder, as described here:

- [HTML](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/HTML.md)

### `auth.json`

Coarse-grained authorisation for HTTP request is set by the entries in the `auth.json` file, which maps URLs and
user roles to GET/POST rights. Detailed description of the file can be found here:

- [auth.json](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/auth.json.md)


### `acl.grl`

The `acl.grl` file implements rule based access for cards to supplement the relatively simple grid-based access
control supported by the combination of card + groups + doors. The `acl.grl` file is documented in more detail 
[here](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/acl.grl.md).

### GRULES files

The _grules_ files implement rule based fine-grained authorisation for view, create, update and delete operations
on individual entities.. The _grules_ files are documented in more detail [here](https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/grules.md).

### JSON files

The system data is (currently) stored as a set of JSON files, described (https://github.com/uhppoted/uhppoted-httpd/blob/master/documentation/db.md).
